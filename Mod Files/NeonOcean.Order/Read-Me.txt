NeonOcean.Order
Made by NeonOcean

--General Information--
	NeonOcean.Order is a standalone mod designed to allow mods to specify the load order of their script paths. It cannot control the 
	import order of individual scripts though they will be done in normal order. This mod will override  the standard loading mechanism of the 
	game but it should function the same as the original. This mod cannot change the load order of any scripts loaded before it and they 
	will load as normal and before most if not all other mods. 

	Please refer to the file license.txt for legal information about this mod.

--Installation instructions--
	Start The Sims 4 and get to the main menu, Press the ESC key and navigate to "Options" and from there to "Other". If it is not already, 
	enable "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed" then quit the game.

	Go to your document's folder then to the folder "Electronic Arts" to, "The Sims 4" and then "Mods". If your mods folder does not exist 
	create a new one. Copy the contents of the mod's download file into your mods folder.

	The installed mod should be functional the next time you start the game. Please do not move any of my mod's files from their intended 
	position as this is not supported.

--Working with this mod (Information for mod creators)--
	Before doing anything this mod will search for load order information in every file named "NeonOcean.Order-Load-Order.json" 
	located in the Mods folder.

	The following is an example of a valid load order information file.

	[
		{
			"Priority" : -5000,
			
			"Paths" : [
				".\\NeonOcean.Main\\NeonOcean.Main.zip"
			],
			
			"Functions" : [
				{
					"Module" : "NeonOcean.Mods",
					"Function" : "_LoadDebug"
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"Priority" : -2500,
			
			"Functions" : [
				{
					"Module" : "NeonOcean.Mods",
					"Function" : "_LoadChoreography"
				}
			]
		}
	]

	The "Priority" value is a float controlling when to import scripts or call functions. All scripts will be imported in order 
	from lowest value to highest value. It also supports decimals and can be positive or negative infinity. All paths destined 
	to be imported by default but have no load order information will be imported at priority 0.

	The "Paths" value is a list of strings containing the locations of any paths made to be imported at this priority level. 
	Any value starting with a period will cause the mod to look for the path from mods folder. Otherwise the mod will look from 
	the directory it found the load order information in. Any path separators at the beginning of the path before or after any period 
	will be ignored.

	The "Functions" value is a list of dictionaries containing functions meant the be called after all scripts in the specified paths 
	are imported.

	Any priority level specified must have a "Paths" or a "Functions" value or it will be ignored.

	Any issues loading the mod will be written to the file at "<Sims 4 user data path>\NeonOcean\Debug\Mods\NeonOcean.Order\<Order start time>\Log.xml>"
